## P02 - MyVector Class 2
### Sudhir Ray
### Description:

This program contains a linked list vector class with methods to add values, remove values, and maintain sorted values if needed. The class is a basic container type of integers that can grow or shrink easily without the need to copy values over to newly allocated memory when resizing. This class also has the ability to be initialized with different data sources (files, other vectors, and arrays).
